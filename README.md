# PictureUploadWebSite

 Unlike project [PictureUploadWebService-Firebase](https://github.com/ulasahin/PictureUploadWebService-Firebase), this site keeps the files in its own Back-End instead of keeping them on a platform such as Google Cloud.

##Technologies Used
- **Front-End:** Angular, Node.js, Javascript, Typescript, HTML, CSS, Media Queries(For mobile device compatibility.)
- **Back-End:** Java 22, Maven, Spring Boot Framework (Spring Security, Spring Boot Web, Spring Boot Data JPA, etc.), Mapstruct, Swagger, Lombok, PostgreSQL

There is also a version of this site created without Back-End and using Firebase. ([see](https://github.com/ulasahin/PictureUploadWebService-Firebase))
